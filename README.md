# ProgressChart
This is the project i have used to monitor the status of migration of data. In one of my assignment i have migrated the data form one old 
system to another system (unfortunatly that was also not new :)). As the migration ran for about 30 hoiurs and total go live ran for about 5 days 
so just for fun and learning i created this tool. The stck i used is as follow:


1. Java 8
2. REST Api
3. Chartjs
4. HTML5
5. Oracle Db

# Framework
